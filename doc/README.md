### Doc folder

### Structure of Jupyter Notebook
Step 1: Import the libraries
Step 2: Fetch Data
Step 3: Determine the target variable
Step 4: Creation of predictors variables
Step 5: Test and train dataset split
Step 6: Create the machine learning classification model using the train dataset
Step 7: Prediction


### Outcome & Analysis

In this project, our finding is that linear regression model is the more appropriate one among four models. There is one company without showing its prediction, which is Company 7, because of insufficient data. Otherwise, the model performs its prediction well in most of the companies. Based on the above plots, the more time series data we have, the more likely our prediction is to be accurate.

It is worthy of being highlighted that the plot of Company 3 demonstrates there is a gap between test data and train data, which can be because the model not fit in this data set; It is also pointed out that in the plot of Company 5 the model predict the different direction of stock. In other words, when the historical data shows the decreasing trend of stock the model predict that the stock will close up.

### Conclusion

"Everything that can be used to predict a company's future has already been used by investors and is 'baked into' today's price. Only unforeseen events will cause stock prices to change. And, unfortunately, unforeseen events -good and bad- happen every day."

Further studies are needed in order to explore on methodology of stock price prediction. Although in this project, we select linear regression model as the more appropriate one among four machine learning classification models and also performs well in seven of the companies (ten companies in total), there are still some issues occurring which may be caused by insufficient training data, insufficient model and so on. Stock prices can be affected but not limited by market performance, company news and performance, industry performance, investor sentiment, and economic factors. We also need to learn how to see the economy working through its numbers, to understand the link between the statistic numbers and the real economy.
