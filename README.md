+ Projec title: Project: Predicting Stock Prices under Machine Learning Classification models
+ This project is conducted by [Guoying Li]

+ Project summary: Many events are unforeseen in stock markets and unforeseen events occur every day and are difficult to predict. With the rise of large scale datasets, it also becomes hard to observe patterns from large-scale time series data by eyes. One of the problems we want to explore is about predicting whether stock price will close up or close down on the next trading day.

Our goal is to explore the patterns of stock prices with time series data under a selected model. First, we will make the comparison among four machine learning classification models (i.e 'linear','poly','rbf','sigmoid') and then select the appropriate one. After that, we will train the data with an appropriate model of the total four machine learning classification models during the prediction process.
